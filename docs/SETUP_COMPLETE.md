### 💡 Pro Tips

**For best results**:
- Be specific about characters (describe appearance, clothing)
- Include action verbs (discovers, tries, realizes)
- Think visually (what viewers will see, not just what happens)
- Use distinctive features for character consistency
- Keep stories focused (comics are visual storytelling)

**Good prompts**:
✅ "A young wizard with blue robes accidentally summons a dragon while studying"
✅ "An astronaut discovers a coffee shop on the moon"
✅ "A chef's soufflé gains sentience during a cooking competition"

**Less effective prompts**:
❌ "Something funny happens" (too vague)
❌ Long paragraphs with too many details (keep it 1-2 sentences)
❌ Abstract concepts without visual elements
