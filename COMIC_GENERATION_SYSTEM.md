## 🎨 Prompt Engineering System

### File: `src/lib/comic-continuity.ts`
**Status:** ✅ Complete & Enhanced

### Art Styles (5 available)
1. **Classic Comic Book** - Bold lines, vibrant colors, halftone shading
2. **Manga Style** - Screentone shading, dramatic angles, speed lines
3. **Graphic Novel** - Realistic proportions, muted palette, atmospheric
4. **Retro Pulp** - 1950s style, limited colors, aged paper texture
5. **Minimalist** - Clean lines, limited colors, negative space

### Panel Composition System
Each panel follows a specific composition strategy:

| Panel | Shot Type | Description | Camera Angle |
|-------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | Establishing | Wide shot to establish setting | Eye level/high |
| 2 | Action | Medium shot on key moment | Dynamic angle |
| 3 | Reaction | Close-up showing outcome | Close for impact |

### Character Consistency
- **Character Token System:** Maintains appearance across panels
- **Technical Requirements:**
  - Same character features in all 3 panels
  - Consistent art style and color palette
  - No text/speech bubbles in images
  - Room for panel borders
  - Professional comic quality

### Prompt Structure
```
Create a comic book panel in [ART STYLE].

PANEL [X]/3 - [SHOT TYPE]:
[Composition description]
Camera angle: [angle]

STORY: [User story with panel focus]

CHARACTER APPEARANCE (keep consistent): [character token]

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Panel X of a 3-panel horizontal comic strip sequence
- Maintain exact character appearance across all panels
- Same art style, color palette, and line quality as other panels
- NO text, speech bubbles, captions, or sound effects in the image
- Leave room at edges for panel borders
- Professional comic book illustration quality
- Clear, legible, high-contrast composition
```

## 📱 Frontend Integration

### File: `src/app/create/page.tsx`
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Features Implemented
- ✅ Real-time streaming progress display
- ✅ Panel-by-panel status updates
- ✅ Individual panel regeneration
- ✅ Loading states for each panel
- ✅ Error recovery with user feedback
- ✅ Character description input
- ✅ Art style selection
- ✅ Save to studio functionality

### User Flow
1. User enters story description (10-500 characters)
2. User selects one of 5 art styles
3. Optional: User adds character description
4. Click "Generate Comic Strip"
5. Watch real-time progress as each panel generates
6. Option to regenerate individual panels
7. Save completed strip to studio

### Streaming Response Handling
```typescript
const reader = response.body?.getReader();
const decoder = new TextDecoder();

while (true) {
  const { done, value } = await reader.read();
  if (done) break;

  const chunk = decoder.decode(value);
  const lines = chunk.split("\n");

  for (const line of lines) {
    if (line.startsWith("data: ")) {
      const data = JSON.parse(line.slice(6));
      // Update UI based on progress/imageUrl/complete
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔐 Security & Authentication

### Implemented
- ✅ Clerk authentication required for all endpoints
- ✅ API key validation (checks if configured)
- ✅ Input validation with Zod schemas
- ✅ Error messages don't leak sensitive info
- ✅ Rate limiting via OpenAI API quotas

### Environment Variables
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-... (configured ✅)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=... (configured ✅)
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=... (configured ✅)
```

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### Sequential Generation
Panels are generated one at a time (not parallel) to:
- Ensure better visual consistency
- Reduce API load
- Provide granular progress updates
- Allow easier error recovery

### Streaming Architecture
- Real-time progress updates via SSE
- No page refresh needed
- Immediate user feedback
- Cancellation support built-in

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### API Testing
```bash
# Test OpenAI connection
GET http://localhost:3000/api/test-generation

# Test full comic generation
POST http://localhost:3000/api/comic-generate
{
  "story": "A cat discovers a magic portal in the backyard",
  "artStyle": "classic",
  "characterDescription": "orange tabby cat with green eyes"
}

# Test single panel regeneration
POST http://localhost:3000/api/regenerate-panel
{
  "panelNumber": 2,
  "story": "A cat discovers a magic portal in the backyard",
  "artStyle": "classic"
}
```

### Input Validation
- ✅ Story length: 10-500 characters
- ✅ Art style: one of 5 enum values
- ✅ Panel number: 1-3 only
- ✅ Character description: optional string

1. **No API Key:** Returns 500 with clear message
2. **Invalid Input:** Returns 400 with Zod validation errors
3. **Unauthorized:** Returns 401 if not authenticated
4. **Generation Failure:** Sends error via stream with panel context
5. **Network Issues:** Frontend catches and displays user-friendly message

### User Feedback
- ✅ Clear error messages (no technical jargon)
- ✅ Specific panel context in errors
- ✅ Recovery instructions provided
- ✅ Status preserved on failure

Each panel maintains:
  - Same character appearance (young woman, red cape)
  - Classic comic book style
  - Visual continuity
  - No text/speech bubbles
```
