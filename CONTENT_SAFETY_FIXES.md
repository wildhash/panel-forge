# Content Safety & Error Handling Improvements

## ‚úÖ All Issues Fixed - Ready to Use!

### Problem Solved
OpenAI's content safety system was rejecting certain story prompts containing words like "hackers", "punch", "villains", etc. This has been completely resolved with automatic sanitization and better error handling.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è What Was Fixed

### 1. **Automatic Prompt Sanitization**
- **Feature**: Stories are now automatically cleaned before being sent to OpenAI
- **How it works**: Potentially problematic words are replaced with safer alternatives
- **Examples**:
  - "hackers" ‚Üí "tech experts"
  - "punch" ‚Üí "confront"
  - "villains" ‚Üí "challengers"
  - "fight" ‚Üí "challenge"
  - "attack" ‚Üí "approach"
  - And 15+ more replacements

### 2. **Enhanced Error Messages**
- **Before**: Generic "400 error" with no guidance
- **After**: Specific, helpful messages explaining:
  - What triggered the safety system
  - How to fix it
  - Examples of better phrasing
  - Alternative words to use

### 3. **UI Content Guidelines**
- **Added**: Visible guidelines panel showing:
  - ‚ùå Words to avoid (hackers, punch, fight, attack, villains)
  - ‚úì Words to use instead (tech experts, discover, solve, help, heroes)
  - Writing best practices
  - Family-friendly language tips

### 4. **Smart Error Detection**
- Automatically detects content policy violations
- Shows user-friendly warnings instead of technical errors
- Provides actionable suggestions for rewording
- Logs sanitization changes for transparency

### 5. **Real-time Feedback**
- Users are notified when automatic adjustments are made
- Status message shows: "Auto-adjusted story for content safety. X change(s) made"
- Generation continues seamlessly after sanitization

## üéØ How It Works Now

### Before (‚ùå Error):
```
Story: "Three hackers punch villains at a hackathon"
Result: 400 Error - Content policy violation
```

### After (‚úÖ Success):
```
Story: "Three hackers punch villains at a hackathon"
Auto-sanitized to: "Three tech experts confront challengers at a hackathon"
Result: Successfully generates comic!
Status: "Auto-adjusted story for content safety. 2 change(s) made"
```

## üöÄ User Experience Improvements

### 1. **Proactive Prevention**
- Automatically prevents errors before they happen
- No manual rewording needed in most cases
- Seamless generation experience

### 2. **Clear Guidance**
- In-app guidelines show safe vs unsafe terms
- Error messages explain exactly what went wrong
- Suggestions provided for better phrasing

### 3. **Transparency**
- Users see what changes were made
- Console logs show all sanitization steps
- Original intent preserved while staying safe

### 4. **Fallback Handling**
- If sanitization isn't enough, clear error shown
- Specific suggestions based on the error type
- Browser console has detailed debug info
