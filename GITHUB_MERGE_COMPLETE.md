## 🎨 Design Integration Needed

The new stories feature uses a different design style than our modernized UI. Here's what needs updating:

### Current Remote Design:
- Blue color scheme (`bg-blue-600`)
- Standard rounded corners (`rounded-md`, `rounded-lg`)
- Lucide icons
- Standard shadows

### Our Modern Design:
- Gray/black color scheme (`bg-gray-900`)
- Consistent rounded corners (2xl, xl, full)
- Thin borders
- Refined shadows (sm, lg, xl)

### Suggested Updates:
1. **Update button colors:** `bg-blue-600` → `bg-gray-900`
2. **Update rounded corners:** `rounded-md` → `rounded-lg`, `rounded-full`
3. **Add ring focus states:** `ring-2 ring-gray-900`
4. **Update shadows:** Match our shadow system
5. **Update borders:** Use thin borders consistently
