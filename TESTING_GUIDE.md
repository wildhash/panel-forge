# Testing OpenAI API Connection

## Quick Test Steps

### 1. Open Browser Console
- Press F12 or right-click → Inspect
- Go to the "Console" tab

### 2. Check Terminal Logs
- Look at the terminal where `npm run dev` is running
- You should see logs when generation starts

### 3. Test the Flow
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Select an art style (e.g., "Classic Comic Book")
3. Enter a story: "A hero saves a cat from a tree"
4. Click the submit button
5. Watch for:
   - Browser console messages
   - Terminal logs showing "✅ OpenAI API key found"
   - Progress updates

### 4. Common Error Messages

**"OpenAI API key not configured"**
- Solution: Check .env file has OPENAI_API_KEY set

**"Unauthorized" or 401 error**
- Solution: API key is disabled for testing, this shouldn't happen

**"Rate limit exceeded" or 429 error**
- Solution: OpenAI account has no credits or hit rate limits
- Check: https://platform.openai.com/account/usage

**"Invalid API key" or 401 from OpenAI**
- Solution: API key is expired or invalid
- Check: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

**"Model not found" or 404**
- Solution: Your OpenAI account doesn't have access to DALL-E 3
- Check account tier at https://platform.openai.com/account/

### 5. What to Look For in Logs

**Terminal should show:**
```
✅ OpenAI API key found, length: 164
🎨 Generating panel 1/3...
📝 Prompt: Create a comic panel in classic comic book style...
✅ Panel 1 generated successfully
🎨 Generating panel 2/3...
📝 Prompt: Create a comic panel in classic comic book style...
✅ Panel 2 generated successfully
🎨 Generating panel 3/3...
📝 Prompt: Create a comic panel in classic comic book style...
✅ Panel 3 generated successfully
```

**Browser console should show:**
```
Generation status updates
Panel image URLs as they're generated
```

### 6. Manual API Test (Optional)

Test your OpenAI key directly:
```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual key from .env

## What I Fixed

1. **Added detailed logging** to track generation progress
2. **Enhanced error messages** with specific error details
3. **Better error handling** in both API and frontend
4. **Verified API key format** - looks correct (164 chars, starts with sk-proj-)

## Next Steps

Try generating a comic and tell me:
1. What error message you see (if any)
2. What's in the browser console
3. What's in the terminal logs

This will help me diagnose the exact issue!
